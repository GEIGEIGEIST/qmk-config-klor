This is the QMK config for the KLOR split keyboard.
Here you can find the ZMK config for the KLOR.

And here you can find the hardware files and build guide




Currently you need to use [this PR](https://github.com/KarlK90/qmk_firmware/tree/feature/raspberry-pi-rp2040-support) instead of the official QMK Repo, if you plan to use the RP2040.
